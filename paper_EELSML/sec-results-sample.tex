\section{Application to WS$_2$ nanostructures}
\label{sec:results_sample}

Following the discussion of the vacuum results, we now move
to present the application of our method to the parametrisation
of EEL spectra recorded on samples.
%
Specifically, we will consider data taken on the WS$_2$ nanostructures
presented in~\cite{SabryaWS2} and reviewed in Sect.~\ref{sec:tmd}.
%
These nanostructures exhibit a flower-like configuration where different layers
of material combine to form the petals and the stem of the flowers.
%
Their geometrical configuration is such that depending on the region
of the nanostructure that one is imaging the spectra will be sensitive
to different thicknesses and orientations of the material.
%
The parametrisation of the ZLP for these in-sample spectra will then be used
to subtract the ZLP contribution and extract the bandgap from
the behaviour of $I_{\rm inel}(\Delta E)$ in the very low-loss region.

%
A collection of electron loss spectra acquired at different positions 
at the specimen is used to construct the neural network training inputs. 
%
These sets of data were obtained directly from~\cite{SabryaWS2}.
%
A specimen image of the positions can be observed in figure~\ref{fig:ws2positions}.  
This nanostructure exhibits flat layers with different thicknesses, which 
can be distinguished from the picture as color differences.
%
Energy loss spectra obtained at positions 1-3 are vacuum recordings, 
positions 4-13 represent in-sample data.
%
One layer (S-W-S) WS$_2$ has a thickness of around 0.9 nm. 
The thickness of the specimen at location 5 is 2.11 nm ($\sim$2 layers).

\subsection{Band-gap determination}


For each replica, the predicted ZLP is subtracted from the individual 
experimental spectra to obtain one set of subtractions. 
Repeating this procedure yields a collection of $N_{rep}$ subtractions 
for each original spectrum, over which statistical properties such as 
median and variance can be calculated.\newline
%
From these subtractions, which contain the 'pure' sample data, 
it is possible estimate the band gap. To a first approximation,
this can be done as the inflection point of the rising intensity.
%
The value can also be roughly estimated from the onset of the absorption 
or from a linear fit to the maximum positive slope in the 
EELS spectrum~\cite{Schamm:2003}. 
%
However, a more accurate and reliable determination is based on the work of 
Rafferty and Brown~\cite{Rafferty:2000}. The onset of the subtracted spectrum 
for a a material with a direct bandgap is expected to follow a function of the type
\begin{equation}\label{eq:I1}
    I(E) = I_0 + c\cdot(dE-E_{BG})^{(b)}
\end{equation}
where I$_0$ and c are constants, b equals 0.5, $\Delta$E is the energy loss and E$_{BG}$ 
is the bandgap energy.For an indirect bandgap, the power of $(1/2)$ changes to $(3/2)$. 
%
Therefore, the bandgap nature (direct or indirect) can be extracted by 
least-squares fitting of each k-th replica subtracted spectrum to equation~\ref{eq:I1}.
%
By averaging over all replicas, one can determine $\textless{b}\textgreater{}$, 
$\textless{E_{BG}}\textgreater{}$ 
and their uncertainties, while keeping track of how the free parameter
E$_{BG}$ is sensitive to the choice of $\Delta$E$_1$, which marks the onset
of the subtracted spectrum intensity.
