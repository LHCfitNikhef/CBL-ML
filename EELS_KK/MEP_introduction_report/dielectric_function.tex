\subsection{Dielectric function}

The dielectric function, also called permitivity, is a measure for the polarisability of a material. From the dielectrc function, a multiplitude of other characaristics can be calculated. Since the dielectric function can be extracted from the electron energy loss spectrum through Kramer-Kronig analysis, for an image of spectra, the dielectric function can be calculated for each pixel.
