7 SEPT:------------------------------------------------------------


Done this week:
- got python working again......
- implemented toy model
- completed notes on K-K analysis
- started adding Fourier transform deconvolution model (FTD) to notes


Talking points:
- discreptancies between different \eps methods
- how to deal with surface scattering etc.

To do:
- complete adding FTD to notes
- write own FTD programm and implement in toy model
- work out/read upon implementations of the dielectric function
- change variable names in notes to match Laus
- dielectric function info
- do last two programs lab



14 SEPT_:----------------------------------------------------------

To do last week:
- complete adding FTD to notes, done
- write own FTD programm and implement in toy model, doneish
- work out/read upon implementations of the dielectric function, todo
- change variable names in notes to match Laus, done
- dielectric function info, todo
- do last two programs lab, dna

Done this week:
- added FTD notes and implemented it to the toymodel, need to discuss results since they are somewhat unexpected, and I'd like to discuss whether that is due to errors, or due to the simplifications in the toymodel
- got Laus programs working
- cleaned up load_data.py (now called load_data_revised.py)
- started in functions.py
- trying to understand Lau's programs line by line to be able to determine what/how to clean

To do:
- work out dielectic function implementation and stuff
- continue cleaning up lau's programs
