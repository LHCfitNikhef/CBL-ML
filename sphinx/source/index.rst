Welcome to the EELSfitter documentation!
========================================


EELSfitter is a Python package capable of providing an in-depth analysis of spectral images obtained with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy using a machine-learning framework. One of the key goals of EELSfitter is to give the EELS scientist a reliable way to substract the Zero-Loss Peak (ZLP) and analyse the physics in the ultra low-loss energy region. For further in-depth analysis after substraction of the ZLP, EELSfitter provides additional tools based on the Kramers-Kronig relations.
