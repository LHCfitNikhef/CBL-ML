# Description of the samples

Specimen = WS2

Growth by Sabrya E. van Heijst by means of CVD

Comments: 
The EELS-SI consists of horizontal WS2 flakes. 

## h-ws2_eels-SI_001

Overlap of different ws2 flakes. The overlap between two flakes could induce new resonances, also it is interesting to investigate the possible presence of strain.

## h-ws2_eels-SI_002: triangular ws2 flake, composed by regions with various thicknesses. It appears that low energy resonances appearing at the edges.  Are the edges of this flake metallic? What about the middle area of the flake? What is the value of the bandgap for the different areas with different thicknesses?
