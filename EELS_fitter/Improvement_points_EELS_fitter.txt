General:
I’d add a cell in which all variable variables are defined: epoch, filenames, etc
Also dE1 and dE2? Or there should be a prompt of some sort where you can say whether you’re happy with the values

Importsectie:
- dubbelop: import tenorflow as tf 
		import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
Import spectra:
- make sure you’re able to define globally what spectra you want to load (and make it clear what kind of path/directory you expect
- for now: add slash after specimen_4 in load_data

Derivatives:
- are wl1 and wl2 the same for all kind of spectra? 
- all_files should be defined in a more robust way

Create plot of derivatives:
- where do the numbers in cm_subsection come from?
- all those arrays should be more robust

Pseudo data:
- are max_x and N_pseudo for all spectra the same?

Create architecture:
- make n_hidden_layers a global input? Or will three always work??
- trow them into a for/while loop

Initialize data:
- are N_pred, pred_min, pred_max the same for all spectra?
- do the splitting sooner so that train_x etc exist

create MC replicas:
- Nrep always the same? Or should it be depended on original dataset?

NN training:
- function_train:
	variables to globalize:
	eta
	Nrep: now different from value above…
	the 25 in for loop in line 18: is that a set value? I’d give it a variable name either way
	training_epochs 
	make display_step training_epochs-depended
	maybe rename a,b,c,d,e,k,l into understandable names?

Serial training:
- globalize d_string
- where do the numbers in in good_files, line 2, predict_x, line 5, saver, line 13 come from? Possible to automize that number?
- globalize saving directionally in line 12
- what is done with prediction_file? Line 21
