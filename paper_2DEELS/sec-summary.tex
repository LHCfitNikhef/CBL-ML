\section{Summary and outlook}

\label{sec:summary}

In this work we have presented a novel, model-independent strategy to parametrise and subtract
the ubiquitous zero-loss peak that dominates  the low-loss region
of EEL spectra.


Say somethihg about the connection of our approach with
indirect Dark Matter searches and how we can efficiently
test new materials that can eventually be used
as dark matter detectors.

\subsection*{Methods}

{\justify
The EEL spectra used for the training of the vacuum ZLP model presented in Sect.~\ref{sec:results_vacuum} were collected in a ARM200F Mono-JEOL microscope equipped with a GIF continuum spectrometer and operated at 60 kV and 200 kV. For these measurements, a slit in the monochromator of 2.8 $\mu$m was used.
%
The TEM and EELS measurements acquired in Specimen A for the results presented in
Sect.~\ref{sec:results_sample} were recorded in a JEOL 2100F microscope with a cold field-emission
gun equipped with aberration corrector operated at 60 kV. A Gatan GIF Quantum was used for
the EELS analyses. The convergence and collection semi-angles were 30.0 mrad and 66.7 mrad respectively.
%
The TEM and EELS measurements acquired for Specimen B in Sect.~\ref{sec:results_sample}
were recorded using a JEM ARM200F monochromated microscope operated at 60 kV and equipped with
a GIF quantum ERS. The convergence and collection semi-angles were 24.6 mrad and 58.4 mrad respectively
in this case, and the aperture of the spectrometer was set to 5 mm.}
