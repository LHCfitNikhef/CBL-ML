# Hello Alien Friends!
For those who don't know/remember, here you have the major steps for uploading or downloading stuff.

# Uploading:
$ git status     (show which files have been changed by you in comparison to what is uploaded at the moment in Git)

$ git add <files you changed>    (add to the upload list the files you changed and want to be added to Git)

$ git commit -m ":sparkles: A small description of what you are adding and changed compared to what is in Git at the moment" 

$ git push     (Uploads everything that you commited)


# Downloading
$ git pull    (Downloads everything from Git that is different from what you have in your pc)
