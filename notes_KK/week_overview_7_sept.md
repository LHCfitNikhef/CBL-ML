Done this week:
- got python working again......
- implemented toy model
- completed notes on K-K analysis
- started adding Fourier transform deconvolution model (FTD) to notes


Talking points:
- discreptancies between different \eps methods
- how to deal with surface scattering etc.

To do:
- complete adding FTD to notes
- write own FTD programm and implement in toy model
- work out/read upon implementations of the dielectric function
- change variable names in notes to match Laus
