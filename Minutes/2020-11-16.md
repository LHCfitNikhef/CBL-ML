* First of all, we agree that we will have our regular work meeting on Fridays at 2pm. Of course not everyone will be able to join always but let's try to keep this slot fixed. So next one is this Friday 20.

* Results of applying the deconvolution method to the samples used in Laurien's paper show that effects are small. This is likely to be due to the fact that the samples are very thin. A nice check would be to try in much thicker samples to see if there the effects of double scatterings are more marked.

* We need to make sure that the formalism used to go from the SSD to the dielectric function is the correct one: the formalism in Egerton is in principle valid only for bulk samples, but we are dealing with very thin ones here.

* The treatment of the DeltaE region does not seem relevant for our current studies, the current option is fine.

* A particularly crucial feature is when Re[epsilon(DeltaE)] crosses the x axis. Why this is the case? And what does it tell us about the local electronic properties of the material?

* What is the role of surface and edge plasmons in the calculation?

* We probably need to account for relativistic effects in the calculation. We could use data at lower Eb to remove these effects. 

* We need to benchmark epsilon_1(DeltaE) and epsilon_2(DeltaE) in some case where we know the answer, to validate the calculation. For this Isabel can use Digital Micrograph, since it has some built-in tools to compute the dielectric function. Similar tools are also available via HyperSpy:

* Need to develop some physical intuition about what the dielectric function is teaching us.

* Luigi will provide Isabel with some benchmark numbers for EEL spectra and the corresponding dielectric  function, so that she can check her calculation. We will also check Martijn's thesis for information.

* What is the asymptotic behaviour of epsilon_1(DeltaE) and epsilon_2(DeltaE) ? And why this is so? Why epsilon_1(DeltaE) => 1 in this limit? Is this because the sample becomes effectively transparent?

* What is the relation between EELS and optical measurements?

* There is the possibility of using a well-understood material such as GaN as benchmark , also in connection with optical properties.

* Isabel will keep going on with her polishing/extension of EELSfitter, since eventually we want to apply the code to the ZLP subtraction in other samples.
