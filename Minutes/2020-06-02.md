# Minutes June 2nd

We are moving over to data on the spectra!

## Methodology 


* Implement smooth matching between different regions: 

Region 1) DeltaE < DeltaE0 => I_model = I_data

Region 2) DeltaE0 < DeltaE < DeltaE1 => I_model from smooth matching.
I_NN = INN * exp(-(dE - dE1)^2 / delta^2)

Region 3) DeltaE1 < DeltaE < 10 * DeltaE2 => I_model unchanged

Region 4) DeltaE > 10 * DeltaE2 => I_model = 0

* Study the second derivative method to determine DeltaE2, normalising by the absolute value of I_data to have a sensible baseline to determine whether or not a change in the second derivative is significant

* Compute the ratio plots using two definitions:

1. R_i^k = I_(i, orig) - I_(i, ZLP) / sigma(ZLP)

where I_(i, orig), I_(i, ZLP) are the original sample signal and the matched ZLP respectively.

2. R_i^k = I_(i, orig) - I_(i, ZLP) / I_(i, ZLP)


## Checks

We should find that as dE $\rightarrow \infty$, R_i^k $\rightarrow \infty$ as the ZLP contribution is imposed to go to zero for high energy loss. 

## Literature study

* Keep working on the paper, in particular the methodology part with all the details on the procedure.
* Add definitions of ratio's to the paper
