We are moving over to data on the spectra!

## Methodology 


* Implement smooth matching between different regions: 

Region 1) DeltaE < DeltaE0 => I_model = I_data

Region 2) DeltaE0 < DeltaE < DeltaE1 => I_model from smooth matching.
\begin{equation}
    I_{NN} = I{NN} * exp(-(dE - dE1)^2 / delta^2)
\end{equation}

Region 3) DeltaE1 < DeltaE < 10 * DeltaE2 => I_model unchanged

Region 4) DeltaE > 10 * DeltaE2 => I_model = 0

* Study the second derivative method to determine DeltaE2, normalising by the absolute value of I_data to have a sensible baseline to determine whether or not a change in the second derivative is significant

* Compute the ratio plots using two definitions:
\begin{equation}
    R_i^k = I_{i, orig} - I_{i, ZLP} / \sigma_{ZLP}
\end{equation}
where $I_{i, orig}, I_{i, ZLP}$ are the original sample signal and the matched ZLP respectively.

\begin{equation}
    R_i^k = I_{i, orig} - I_{i, ZLP} / I_{i, ZLP}
\end{equation}


## Checks

We should find that as dE $\rightarrow \infty$, R_i^k $\rightarrow \infty$ as the ZLP contribution is imposed to go to zero for high energy loss. 

## Literature study

* Keep working on the paper, in particular the methodology part with all the details on the procedure.
* Add definitions of ratio's to the paper
