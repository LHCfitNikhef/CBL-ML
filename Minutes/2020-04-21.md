## Errors in vacuum ZLP

### Error propagation
We need to propagate the error in an efficient way. If we know Data on E1 --> What is error on E2?
- Interpolation (if we have data on 60 and 200 keV: try ~120 keV). Error should be good.
- Extrapolation (different E_beam, t_exp and dE outside training region). Error should be bad.

### Relative errors
Unbiased model should lead to an increase in error outside the extrapolation region. 
Relative Error(T(dE, Ebeam, Texp)): vary Ebeam and check that the relative error outside the training region is big. 

## Data on samples 

Main question: **Is the ZLP in EELS in a sample the same as in vacuum?**
In order to answer: train NN on vacuum and train NN on data. 
Check: within the sample, the shape of the ZLP should change on the positive energy loss side, but should remain the same on the negative side.
