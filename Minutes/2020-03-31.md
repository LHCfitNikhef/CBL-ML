# Minutes 31st March

## Methodology

- Scale both the x and the y data between 0.1 and 0.9;
- Fit a 2D function f(dE, t) to the y-data for the model to be able to predict and fit also data taken on different exposure times. Start from a Gaussian f(dE) fit and then included the dependence on exposure time.


## Checks

- Important to solve the bug in the script is to check whether it is because of the data or because of the NN. In order to check this, you can apply SGD to train on mini batches; this should solve the possibility of being in a local minimum. 
- Add as a second dimension again the training data; this really shouldn't make a difference.
