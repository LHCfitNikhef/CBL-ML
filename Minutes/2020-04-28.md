### Nikhef account
Juan arrange a Nikhef account for Laurien from now until the end of 
her master project. This will allow her to access the Nikhef computing 
cluster and thus run her jobs there. 
Since in a cluster one can parallelise jobs, the idea is that the 
total time to train a model, even for 1000 replicas, will be more or 
less the same time it takes to train a individual replica.
This is important because our goal is to study properties of the model 
distribution (properties over the whole replica sample) rather than of 
individual replicas, that in general are rather less methodologically 
stable.

* To make this possible, Laurien will rearrange her notebook into a 
single piece of python code in a way that it can be launched via scripts 
in a computing cluster.

* This also requires some bookkeeping, to store separately the results 
of each replica, including the state of the network for every iteration 
(to then implement the look-back stopping algorithm).

## Methodology 
* We have to impose, when generating replicas, that negative values of 
the EELS spectra are generated (unphysical). There are many ways to 
impose this constraint, the easier is to replace the negative values by 
zero.

* At some point we will also try to see if preprocessing speeds up the 
fitting, for example by subtracting to the data its Gaussian fit (so 
that the NN have to learn essentially the pattern of data residuals with 
respect to the Gaussian fit).
