# Minutes 7th April

## Methodology

- Each training sample [dE_i, T_j] with i=(1, .., Nsamples) should be defined by [D, sigma] where D and sigma are the mean and deviation within each energy bin: D = <D_i> over all spectra. Then, MC is generated with y_MC = D + randn(0,sigma). 
- We can look for the effect of the esposure time for each MC replica: the ratio R(k) = T(k)(dE, T1) / T(k)(dE, T2) and average over all replicas to find the expectation value of R(T1/T2) and sigma(T1/T2). This way we take into account error correlation.  


## Checks

- Generating data as described in the first bullet above, Chi2 should converge to 1 training on the training data and it should converge to approx. 2 training on the MC data.
- Plotting Chi2(k) over replicas k, with k = (1, ..., Nrep) should give a Gaussian distribution around 1 or 2 (see previous bullet and Fig. 10 in. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.4407.pdf). 
- Include statistical estimators to gauge the fit quality, such as in https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0204232.

## Lookout
- Subtraction of the fitted spectra should be done as: Spectrum(dE) - MC ZLP(dE, T, V) for each MC replica
- Try data from different telescopes, same samples
