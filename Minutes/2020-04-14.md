# Minutes 14th April

## Data

- We need (dE, T_exp and E_beam) as training inputs.
- For now, we proceed with data on 10ms and 100ms exposure time, as data we have on 2ms do not make a lot of physical sense.


## Checks

- Residual loss: fit the residuals, R = (T - D) / sigma. Should be a gaussian spread with std --> 1. 
- How do the predictions vary with the number of bins?


## Write

- Create a Wiki in the Github to elaborate on methods and describe how I find (D, sigma)
- Create a table in markdown with an overview of all the results

## Later

- We might want to check in a later stage if we should take correlations into accounts.
